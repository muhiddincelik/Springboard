# Data Modeling: Schema Design and Generating DDL Commands

## Introduction

In this project, We will look at Euro Cup 2016 data and write queries to answer our questions. For each of these exercises, you can find solution sql files in the **[sql_files](sql_files)** folder. Description of tables adn the data modeling schema is in the **[docs](docs)** folder.
